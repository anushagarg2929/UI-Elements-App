# UI/UX Hiding elements(A practice app)

UI is a important part in any development work. As much as the good UI design we want to show on our page some we have hide also so that they can pop that the correct time. It is a very useful development tool I have learnt which can help me make a more beautiful app designs and multipage apps as well.
